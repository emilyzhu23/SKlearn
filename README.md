#### Models: Logistic Regression and Ridge Classifier - also used two different scaling models
#### Graphing: Heat map and relationship between two variables
#### Dataset: Heart failure analysis 
#### What did you find interesting about this data set?  Why did you choose it?: I thought this data set was interesting because of its real world applications. All of the independent variables are measurable quantities and it's fascinating to imagine how using these variables can help prevent heart attacks. I also thought the number of independent variables was pretty large and I was curious to see if that would make the predicitions more or less accurate.
